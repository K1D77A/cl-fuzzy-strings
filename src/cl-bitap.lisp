;;;;My attempt at the Bitap algorithm described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm
#| The bitap algorithm (also known as the shift-or, shift-and or Baeza-Yates–Gonnet algorithm)
;; is an approximate string matching algorithm. The algorithm tells whether a given text contains a substring which is "approximately equal" to a given pattern, where approximate equality is defined in terms of Levenshtein distance — if the substring and pattern are within a given distance k of each other, then the algorithm considers them equal.
;; The algorithm begins by precomputing a set of bitmasks containing one bit for each element of the
 pattern. Then it is able to do most of the work with bitwise operations, which are extremely fast.|#

;;;point of note this is not in a functional style.
